COT-GAN is an adversarial algorithm to train implicit generative models. In addition to simply using recurrent network structure to model sequential data,  the contribution of COT-GAN is to propose an objective function, formulated using ideas from **Causal Optimal Transport (COT)**, which naturally encodes a causality constaint.  
This objective function is optimised for learning time dependent data distributions and generic for all data of sequential nature, e.g., in the application of video, audio, music, stock prices.
